## 0.3-beta

Congratulates, I make some meaningful updates.

Support 3 ways to decompile class file:
- QuiltFlower (FernFlower)
- Procyon
- CFR

Rebuild UI and add a progress bar showing the progress of loading jars.

Interestingly, I have added some example cases in the README.md.

Finally, I made an exe version, but you need have a local JRE 11-17 environment.

Important:
- Add CFR and QuiltFlower decompilers #8
- [docs] add a more complex example case #9
- [new feature] a progress bar to show load jar progress #4

Bugs:
- [bug] code panel cannot resize #10

Others:
